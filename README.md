# Mexican POS System with CFDI Support

## Overview
This Point of Sale (POS) system is designed for Mexican businesses, providing full support for CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) invoicing.

## Features
- Sales management
- Product inventory
- CFDI invoice generation
- Tax calculation
- Reporting

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up environment variables in `.env`
3. Initialize database: `python setup_db.py`
4. Run the application: `python start_pos.py`

## Configuration
Ensure you have your SAT (Servicio de Administraci√≥n Tributaria) credentials configured for CFDI generation.

## Database System
This POS system uses:
- **Primary Database**: MongoDB Atlas cloud-hosted database for online operation
- **Fallback Database**: SQLite local database for offline operation or when MongoDB connectivity fails

### Database Backup
The system automatically backs up MongoDB data to SQLite when you run the application using `start_pos.py`. This ensures that you can continue operating even during internet outages.

To manually backup MongoDB data:
```bash
python backup_mongodb.py
```

### Database Architecture
The application is designed to work seamlessly with both databases:
1. When starting the application, it attempts to backup MongoDB data to SQLite
2. All database operations first attempt to use SQLite
3. If SQLite operations fail, the system automatically falls back to MongoDB

This architecture provides both offline capability and data redundancy.
